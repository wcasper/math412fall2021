### About Me
I obtained concurrently a B.S. in Mathematics, a B.S. in Physics, and a M.S. in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 2010.  Following this, I did a stint at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) as a post-baccalaureate researcher before continuing on to a graduate program at the University of Washington in Seattle (UW), while continuing research at LANL during summers.  After obtaining my Ph.D. in Mathematics from UW in 2017, I spent three years as a post-doc at Louisiana State University and joint CSUF in 2020.



My research focuses on applications of algebra and algebraic geometry to various problems in pure and applied mathematics. Specific research interests include orthogonal polynomials, integrable systems, spectral theory of integral and differential operators, and noncommutative crepant resolutions. Additionally, his research includes work in computational fluid dynamics and high performance computing.

### Past/Current Research Projects with Students (as of 2021)
* Using orthogonal matrix polynomials for nonlinear eigenvalue problems
* Exploring exact equations and recurrence relations for matrix-valued Chebyshev-type polynomials
* Solving Battleship puzzle problems using discrete tomography and quantum computing
