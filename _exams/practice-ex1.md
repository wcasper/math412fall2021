### Directions
Solve each of the following problems. If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial. If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

**Problem 1:** 

Let $$\sqrt{z}$$ denote the principal square root of $$z$$.
Express each of the following values in polar form $$re^{i\theta}$$.

* (A)  $$1 + \sqrt{3}i$$ 
* (B)  $$(1 + i)^{2020}$$
* (C)  $$\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}$$
* (D)  $$2^{1+i}$$

**Problem 2:** 
Prove that if $$f(x + iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$$ is analytic, then $$u(x,y)$$ must be a harmonic function.

**Problem 3:**

Use the Cauchy Riemann equations to prove that the function $$f(z) = e^z$$ is analytic.

**Problem 4:**

Consider the complex map

$$\chi(z) = \frac{z+i}{z-i}.$$

* (A) What is the image of the unit circle under $$\chi(z)$$?
* (B) What is the image of the real axis under $$\chi(z)$$?
* (C) What is the image of the imaginary axis under $$\chi(z)$$?
* (D) Let $$\text{Log}(z)$$ denote the principal log and let

$$f(z) =  \text{Log}\left(\frac{z+i}{z-i}\right).$$

At what points is the function $$f(z)$$ defined?  At what points is it continuous?

**Problem 5:**

Show that

$$u(x,y) = \frac{y}{x^2+y^2}$$

is harmonic.  Then find a harmonic conjugate $$v(x,y)$$ of $$u(x,y)$$.

**Problem 6:**

* (A) Find an analytic function which maps the set of complex numbers $$\{x + iy: y>x\}$$ to the upper half plane $$\mathbb H = \{x + iy: y>0\}$$.
* (B) Find an analytic function which maps the set of complex numbers $$\{x + iy: y>x\}$$ to the inside of the unit disk.
