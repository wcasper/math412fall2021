### Directions
Solve each of the following problems. If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial. If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

**Problem 1:** 

Find all solutions of the equation

$$z^4 = (1 + \sqrt{3}i)$$

**Problem 2:** 

Determine all possible values of the expression

$$(1 + \sqrt{3}i)^i$$

**Problem 3:**

Suppose that $$f: \mathbb C\rightarrow\mathbb C$$ is a holomorphic function satisfying $$f(z) = f(z + 1)$$ and $$f(z) = f(z+i)$$ for all $$z\in\mathbb C$$.
Show that $$f(z)$$ must be constant.

**Problem 4:**

Calculate the value of the integral

$$\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos(x)}{\cos(x) + a} dx,\ \ a>1$$

**Problem 5:**

Calculate the following residues

* (A) $$\text{Res}[1/(1+z^2),i]$$
* (B) $$\text{Res}[e^{2z}/(z-1)^2,1]$$

**Problem 7:** 

Suppose that $$u(x,y)$$ and $$v(x,y)$$ are harmonic functions on $$D$$ which are harmonic conjugates satisfying $$u^2+v^2>0$$.  Prove that $$\log(u^2+v^2)$$ is also harmonic on $$D$$.

**Problem 8:** 

Find the Laurent series expansion of the function  $$f(z) = \frac{1}{z(z-1)(z-2)}$$ in the indicated regions

* (A) $$0 < \lvert z\rvert < 1$$
* (B) $$1 < \lvert z\rvert < 2$$
* (C) $$2 < \lvert z\rvert $$

**Problem 9:**

Suppose that $$f(z)$$ is an analytic function on $$\mathbb C$$ satisfying the property that $$f(1/n) = \frac{1}{n^3}-\frac{1}{n^5}$$ for all $$n\geq 2$$.
Determine, with proof, the value of $$f(2)$$.
