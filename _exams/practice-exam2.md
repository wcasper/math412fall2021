### Directions
Solve each of the following problems. If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial. If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

**Problem 1:** 

True or False.
* (A) If $$f(z)$$ is entire and $$|f(z)|\geq 1$$ for all $$z\in\mathbb C$$ then $$f(z)$$ is constant
* (B) The limit of a sequence of analytic functions is analytic
* (C) If $$f(z)$$ is analytic for all $$|z|<1.5$$ then the integral $$\oint_{|z|=1} f(z)dz = 0$$
* (D) $$|\sin(z)|\leq 1$$ for all $$z\in \mathbb C$$
* (E) If $$z_0,z_1\in\mathbb D$$ are two distinct points then $$\int_{\partial\mathbb D} \frac{1}{(z-z_0)(z-z_1)} dz = 0$$

**Problem 2:** 
Give an example of each of the following, or else explain why no example exists

* (A) a series which converges, but which does not converge absolutely
* (B) a power series $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_kz^k$$ which diverges for all $$z\neq 0$$
* (C) a smooth, real-valued function on $$\mathbb R$$ which is not identically zero, but which satisfies $$f^{(k)}(0) = 0$$ for all $k\geq 0$$
* (D) a nonzero entire function $$f(z)$$ satisfying $$f(0) = 0$$ and $$f(1/n)=0$$ for all $$n\geq 1$$

**Problem 3:**

Prove that if a sequence of functions $$f_n(z)$$ converges to $$f(z)$$ uniformly, then $$f(z)$$ is analytic.

**Problem 4:**

Suppose that $$f(z)$$ is an entire function and that $$f(z)/z^n$$ is bounded for $$|z|>2021$$.  Prove that $$f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $$n$$.

**Problem 5:**

Calculate the following values and carefully justify your work.  If you use any specific theorems, be sure to name them.

* (A) $$\int_{\Gamma} xydy$$ where $$\Gamma$$ is the boundary of the square with vertices $$(0,0)$$, $$(0,1)$$, $$(1,0)$$, and $$(1,1)$$
* (B) $$\oint_{|z|=1} \frac{1}{z^3}dz.$$
* (C) $$\int_{\Gamma} \cos(z)dz$$ where $$\Gamma$$ is the path from $$(-\pi,0)$$ to $$(\pi,0)$$ along the curve $$y=\sin(x)$$
* (D) $$\oint_{|z-1-i| = 5/4} \frac{\Log(z)}{(z-1)^2}dz$$

**Problem 6:**

Suppose that $$f(z)$$ is analytic on a domain $$D$$ containing the disk $$|z-z_0|\leq r$$.
Use Cauchy's integral formula to prove that $$f(z_0)$$ is equal to the average value of $$f(z)$$ on the circle $$|z-z_0| = r$$.
