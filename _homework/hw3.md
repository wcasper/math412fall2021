### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* encoded in Braille on a static HTML page for unfathomable reasons

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** Calculate the following line integrals

* (A) $$\int_\Gamma 2ydx + (1-x)dy$$ for $$\Gamma$$ the curve $$y = 1-x^3$$ from $$(-1,2)$$ to $$(2,-7)$$.
* (B) $$\oint_\Gamma xydx$$ where $$\Gamma$$ is the boundary of the square formed by the vertices $$(1,0)$$, $$(0,1)$$, $$(0,0)$$ and $$(1,1)$$ oriented counter-clockwise.

**Problem 2:** 
Suppose that $$P(x,y)$$ and $$Q(x,y)$$ are smooth functions on the annulus $$\{z\in\mathbb C: a < \lvert z\rvert < b\}$$ and that the differential $$Pdx + Qdy$$ is closed.
Show that the value of the following integral is independent of $$r$$ for all $$r\in (a,b)$$

$$\oint_{\lvert z\rvert = r} P(x,y)dx + Q(x,y) dy$$

[Hint: Use Greens Theorem]

**Problem 3:** 

Let $$\Gamma$$ be the unit circle in the complex plane with counter-clockwise rotation.  Evaluate the following integrals for $$m=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\dots$$

* (A) $$\oint_\Gamma z^m dz$$
* (B) $$\oint_\Gamma \overline{z}^mdz$$
* (C) $$\oint_\Gamma z^m|dz|$$

**Problem 4:**Â  

Show that if $$D$$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, then
$$\int_{\partial D} \overline{z} dz = 2i\text{Area}(D).$$
