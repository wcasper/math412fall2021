### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* sent by the dark arts to Unrak the Unforgiving, Keeper of the Abyss

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** Let $$n>1$$ be an integer.  Prove the following

* (A) $$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (z-e^{2\pi i k/n}) = z^n-1$$
* (B) $$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi i k/n} = (-1)^n$$
* (C) $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi i k/n} = 0$$

**Problem 2:** For each of the following sets of complex numbers, describe the shape of the set and sketch the set in the complex plane.

* (A) $$\{z: \lvert z-1-i\rvert = 1\}$$
* (B) $$\{z: 1 < \lvert 2z-6\rvert < 2\}$$
* (C) $$\{z: \text{Re}(iz + 2) > 0\}$$
* (D) $$\{z: \lvert z-1\rvert < \lvert z\rvert\}$$

**Problem 3:**  Let $$\rho: S^2\rightarrow\mathbb C$$ be stereographic projection and let $$T: S^2\rightarrow S^2$$ be the rotation of the sphere by $$180\deg$$ around the $$x-$$axis.  Find an explicit expression for the M\"obius transformation

$$\chi(z) = \rho(T(\rho^{-1}(z))).$$

**Problem 4:**  The unit disk in the complex plane is the set $$\mathbb D = \{z: \lvert z\rvert < 1\}$$.  For each of the following functions, sketch the image of $$\mathbb D$$ under the function.

* (A) $$f(z) = z^2$$ 
* (B) $$f(z) = 1/z$$
* (C) $$f(z) = \frac{z+1}{z-1}$$
