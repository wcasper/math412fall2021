### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* arranged into a traditional disco song and dance routine

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.


**Problem 1:**
Let $$f(z) = c_0 + c_1z + \dots + c_nz^n$$ be a polynomial.
Prove the inequality

$$\int_{-1}^1 |f(x)|^2dx \leq \pi\int_{0}^{2\pi}|f(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta = \pi\sum_{k=0}^n |c_k|^2.$$

[Hint: first consider the case when the coefficients $$c_0,\dots,c_n$$ are real and apply Cauchy's theorem to the function $$f(z)^2$$ on both the top and bottom halves of the unit circle separately]

**Problem 2:**
Evaluate the following line integrals

* (A) $$\oint_{|z|=4}e^{\cos(z)}dz$$
* (B) $$\oint_{|z|=1}\frac{\cosh(z)}{z^3} dz$$
* (C) $$\oint_{|z|=1}\frac{dz}{z^2(z^2-4)e^z}dz$$
* (D) $$\oint_{|z-1|=2}\frac{dz}{z(z^2-4)e^z}dz$$

**Problem 3:**

Use Cauchy's integral formula on the domain $$D_R = \{z\in\mathbb C: \text{Re}(z)>0,\ |z|< R\}$$ to show that

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\cos(x)}{1+x^2}dx = \frac{\pi}{e}.$$

**Problem 4:**

Use Liouville's theorem to show that if $$u$$ is harmonic on $$\mathbb C$$ and bounded above, then $$u$$ must be constant.

[Hint: consider exponentiating]
