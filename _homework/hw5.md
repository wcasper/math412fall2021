### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* emailed to M. Night Shyamalan as a potential plot for his next film

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.


**Problem 1:**

Find all possible Laurent series expansions centered at $$0$$ for each of the following functions.  Make sure to carefully describe the domain where each series converges absolutely.

* (A) $$1/(z^2-z)$$ (should have two series)
* (B) $$(z-1)/(z+1)$$ (should have two series)
* (C) $$(z^2-1)^{-1}(z^2-4)^{-1}$$ (should have three series)

**Problem 2:**

Find the radius of convergence of the power series of the following functions expanded about the indicated points.

* (A) $$(z-1)/(z^4-1)$$ about $$z = 3+i$$
* (B) $$z/\sin(z)$$ about $$z = i\pi$$
* (C) $$z^2/\sin^3(z)$$ about $$z= i\pi$$

**Problem 3:**

Suppose that $$f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k z^k$$ is analytic for $$\lvert z\rvert | < R$$ and that $$f(z)$$ extends meromorphically to  $$\lvert z\rvert | < R$$ with a single pole at some value $$z_0$$ with $$\lvert z_0\rvert = R$$.  Show that $$a_k/a_{k+1}\rightarrow z_0$$ as $$k\rightarrow\infty$$.

**Problem 4:**
For each of the following functions, determine the principal part of the function at each of the poles (including possibly $$\infty$$).

* (A) $$1/\sin(z)$$
* (B) $$z^2/(z-1)$$

**Problem: 5**

Find the partial fraction decompositions of the following functions

* (A) $$1/(z^2-z)$$
* (B) $$(z+1)^{-1}(z^2+2z+2)^{-1}$$

**Problem: 6**

Calculate the following residue values

* (A) $$\text{Res}[1/(z^2+4),2i]$$
* (b) $$\text{Res}[\cos(z)/z^2,0]$$
* (c) $$\text{Res}[e^z/z^5,0]$$
* (d) $$\text{Res}[1/(z^5-1),1]$$


**Problem: 7**

Use residue theory to get the exact value of

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2+1}dx$$
