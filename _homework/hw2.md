### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* composed into an Old English epic poem reminiscent of Beowolf

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** Determine the value or possible values of each of the following

* (A) $$e^{37\pi i}$$
* (B) $$(1+i)^i$$
* (C) $$i^{i^i}$$

**Problem 2:** Prove the angle addition formulas for complex sine and cosine

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin(z + w) &= \sin(z)\cos(w) + \cos(z)\sin(w)\\
\cos(z + w) &= \cos(z)\cos(w) - \sin(z)\sin(w)
\end{align*}
$$

**Problem 3:** 

Show that there exists a \emph{continuous} complex-valued function $f(z)$ defined for all $\lvert z\rvert >1$ satisfying

$$(f(z))^2 = z^2 + 1/z.$$

**Problem 4:**Â  

The inverse tangent function is the multi-valued function

$$\tan^{-1}(z) = \{w\in \mathbb C: \tan(w) = z\}.$$

Show that

$$\tan^{-1}(z) = \frac{1}{2i}\log\left(\frac{1+iz}{1-iz}\right),$$

where here the equality is saying that both sets have the same elements.

**Problem 5:**
Prove the following limits using the formal definition of a limit.

* (A) $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{n}{n+1} = 1$$
* (B) $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{z^n}{n!} = 0$$ for all $$z\in\mathbb C$

**Problem 6:**
For which values of $$\alpha\in\mathbb C$$ does the principal power $$z^\alpha$$ of $$z$$ have a limit as $$z\rightarrow 0$$?
Carefully justify your answer.

**Problem 7:**
Show that $$u(x,y) = \sin(x)\sinh(y)$$ and $$v(x,y) = \cos(x)\cosh(y)$$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and determine a simple expression (in terms of $$z$$ only) for the function $$f(z)$$ satisfying

$$f(x + iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y).$$
